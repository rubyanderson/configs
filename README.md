# configs

Here I keep all of my config files so I can be up and running with Debian in no time. 

## Requirements

These configs config `i3` and `vim` and requires `feh`. `xfce4-terminal` is a nice terminal that enables transparancy and some other good stuff.

```
apt-get install i3
apt-get install vim
apt-get install feh
apt-get install xfce4-terminal
```
